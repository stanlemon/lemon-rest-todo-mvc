TodoMVC with Symfony & LemonRestBundle
============
This is a demo of [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com) using [Symfony](http://symfony.com) and the [LemonRestBundle](http://github.com/stanlemon/rest-bundle) using [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org). Take a quick look around and you'll see it's mostly copy-pasted right out of the TodoMVC repository, the actual REST backend is super easy thanks to the convention-driven LemonRestBundle.

**The easiest way to take this for a spin is by using Symfony's baked in server:run command.
